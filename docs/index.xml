      <description>I set up the infrastructure for this site over a year ago but never got around to actually using it. There are a few reasons why I&#39;m starting now:
 I want to engage more deeply with my projects and experiments It&#39;s good writing practice Occasionally I think of interesting things and want to share more of them  These reasons could have worked just as well a year ago, but oh well!</description>

      <description>Hi, I&#39;m Michael. I like to play with technology, so I build a lot of toy projects. Outside of computers, I like math, music, behavioral science, philosophy, and a lot of other things.
During the year, I study math and computer science at UChicago. Previously, I spent three enriching months at the Recurse Center.</description>
