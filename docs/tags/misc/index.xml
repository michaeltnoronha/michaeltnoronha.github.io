      <description>I set up the infrastructure for this site over a year ago but never got around to actually using it. There are a few reasons why I&#39;m starting now:
 I want to engage more deeply with my projects and experiments It&#39;s good writing practice Occasionally I think of interesting things and want to share more of them  These reasons could have worked just as well a year ago, but oh well!</description>
