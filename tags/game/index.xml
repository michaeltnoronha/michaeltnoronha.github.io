      <description>Omega Transmission is a browser-based space shooter that I worked on with a team as a part of Gamkedo Club. It includes a series of increasingly challenging waves with a variety of enemy types. Like other games of the genre, the controls are intuitive and easily picked up, but difficulty ramps up quickly.
As a team member I contributed to code and art:
 Added the fleet enemy type and built upon existing assets to produce its sprite.</description>
