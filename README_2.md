I accidentally deleted the CSS of my box site, however I did have a tab open that had not been refreshed since earlier in the morning.
While there are a few things that are not perfect, I took a screenshot of each tab and will upload them to this branch.
If there is time in the morning, I will push the box version of the site and remove the images
